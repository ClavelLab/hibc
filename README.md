# hibc

`hibc` is the code repository for the website of ["Human Intestinal Bacteria Collection"](https://hibc.rwth-aachen.de). 
It contains the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code to generate the website in the form of a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) interactive application. The application is then build as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container and served online to the public at <https://hibc.rwth-aachen.de>.


## Development

Whilst all the code is accessible and pull-requests are welcome, some of the features for the deployment of the shiny application are restricted to RWTH personnel.

### Create the R project via Rstudio

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://git.rwth-aachen.de/clavellab/hibc`
2. Open the Rstudio project in `hibc/app/app.Rproj` to create the `app` project
3. Rstudio warns you that `One or more packages recorded in the lockfile are not installed` because a couple of R packages and dependencies are needed.
	1. Install the dependencies by typing `renv::restore()` in the Console and agree to the installation of the packages.
	2. Check that all dependencies are set by typing `renv::status()` in the Console where you should have `No issues found`
4. Preview the Shiny app via the "Run app" button or by typing `shiny::runApp()` in the R console.


### Build the docker container locally

You can test if the Shiny application is ready for deployment by building the docker container locally.

```bash
# build the Dockerfile
docker build -t hibc-shiny .
# run the shiny app
docker run -it -d -p 3838:3838 hibc-shiny
# access locally on your browser with
firefox http://localhost:3838
```

### Create a release to trigger the deployment

Once the edits and tests are satisfying, the deployment of the website is triggered by the creation of a tagged release.

1. Tag the git commit using `git tag -a vX.Y.Z` where X, Y and Z follows the <https://semver.org>
2. Push the tag to the remote with `git push --tags`
3. Create a Gitlab release using the Releases section or <https://git.rwth-aachen.de/clavellab/hibc/-/releases/new>
